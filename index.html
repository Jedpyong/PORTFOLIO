            <p>Well I am just a simple guy who's lazy and doesn't have a passion in programming but is interested on technologies. Yet here I am now taking a course that's very hard like almost all subjects are like mikusmikusing my brain to it's limit to the point that I don't even trust simple and obvious things anymore like 1+1 hays. Still am thankful for that coz I learned programming languages such as Assembly,C, C++, java and C#. However, I already forgot a lot about those, so I have to review it if you'll come to me and make me apply those. Therefore, never approach me unless I like u and u like me.</p>
            <p>If you thought I love studying coz I was able to stay regular up to this point, na! it's only a "Thank you blockmates" and "No man is an island" things. In fact did you know that I only love eating and being alone, I love foods and music yet here Am I standing 5 feet small and doesn't have any talent on music at all. Just how funny this life could be? Lalay, ako nalang ka bi.</p>
